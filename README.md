# USER OVERVIEW AND TUTORIAL (START HERE)

This application was designed to streamline data definition processes.

To configure and launch the application:

1. Copy and paste the Data-Request-Builder.bat file from the project directory to the desired location on your computer
2. Open and edit the .bat file using Notepad or another text editing program. Change the first command of the .bat file to use the install location of the application. For example, if the application is saved at C:\Users\me\data_request_builder, the first line of the .bat file would read "cd C:\Users\me\data_request_builder"
3. Double-click on the .bat file to launch the software. This should create a command line window which will launch the software in your browser.
4. NOTE: Just because the application utilizes an internet browser as a GUI, it is not connected to the internet. The browser is just communicating with a server hosted locally by your computer.
5. When finished using the application close both the browser and command line window.
6. Data definition output files will get saved to a newly created Data Request Builder Output folder in your Documents folder (C:\Users\you\Document\Data Request Builder Output)
7. Session configurations can be saved to a text file. Custom text files can also be generated and uploaded from the application to automatically pick up where a previous session left off or to start from a pre-configured template. The docs\input folder has two example text files with session configurations (one file with and another without checkbox true/false values)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run launch`

This script launches both the python backend server and the javascript frontend server to provide a full end-to-end user experience. This script will be what a user should run when they want to use the software as it was intended to be used.
